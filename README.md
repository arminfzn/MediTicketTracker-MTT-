A tool to track the used and unused vouchers

How does it work?
1. You copy all your codes in the codes.txt file.
2. Go to dist/MTT/MTT.exe and execute it.
3. It will ask for the location of the codes.txt file.
    1. Right click on codes.txt and copy the location.
    2. Paste the location into the window with the prompt and add \codes.txt after your copied location.
4. Now it should work and give you all the codes with eiter used or unused back.
